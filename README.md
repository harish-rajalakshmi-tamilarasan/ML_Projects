# Machine Learning Learning Repository

This repository contains my Machine Learning files and projects for learning and experimenting with various ML algorithms, NLP, and Computer Vision concepts.

## Contents
- Custom implementations of Machine Learning algorithms:
  - Simple Neural Networks (NN)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
  - Naive Bayes
  - And more...

- Basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP):
  - Text Preprocessing
  - Bag of Words (BoW)
  - TF-IDF
  - Word Embeddings

- Computer Vision (CV) Learnings:
  - Image Classification
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Data Augmentation

## Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey in the field of Machine Learning and provide hands-on implementations and examples of the concepts I've studied.

Feel free to explore the code, use it for reference, and provide feedback!
